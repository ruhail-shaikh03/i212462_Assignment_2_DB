Database Systems Assignment 2

---Query-1----
After reading the case study, we used Lucid Chart to create an ERD for the Database. Firstly we listed all the entities with their attributes, then we made their relationships with eachother. Once entities were made it was pretty straigt forward afterwards.

---Query-2---
After making the ER Diagram, we listed down all the tables with their attributes. There was no as such problem while creating the tables, it was just boring to add the dummy data in those tables.
